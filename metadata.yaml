description: After her parents' bitter divorce, young Maisie Farange finds herself
  shuttled between her selfish mother and vain father, who value her only as a means
  for provoking each other. Maisie -- solitary, observant and wise beyond her years
  -- is drawn into an increasingly entangled adult world of intrigue and sexual betrayal,
  until she is finally compelled to choose her own future. What Maisie Knew is a subtle
  yet devastating portrayal of an innocent adrift in a corrupt society. Part of a
  relaunch of three James titles.
